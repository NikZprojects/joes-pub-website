One adds spice, one adds body, one adds sweetness. It's a rather tricky mix to come by as I've only found one distillery (in NC) that makes the sweet potato and one distillery (in NY) which makes the apple, but then again, if a secret was easy, how much fun would that be??

'The Alaska' is simply gin and yellow chartreuse. Issue is: I only have green chartreuse. Apparently the difference is mainly just the addition of honey to temper the herbal notes, so I decided to make some makeshift yellow from my green. The choice of gin is incredibly important. This one comes from a small winery in Upstate New York. It's subtle and peppery making it a nice one to pair with the chartreuse. So, here's my take on 'The Alaska' (thanks for the inspiration, Dov)! *\n1.5oz gin (#demaresthillwinery)\n0.5oz green chartreuse\n2bar spoons of honey syrup (1:1V)\n2dashes of orange bitters\n\nStir gin, chartreuse, and honey over ice.

The topic: The Big Screen. A movie inspired cocktail. There's no movie that deserves a drink more than 'Citizen Kane'. Called \"the most influential movie ever made\" and \"the #1 movie of all time,\" nominated for 9 academy awards and winner of Best Original Screenplay (1942), this film has withstood the test of time and still tops lists by USA today and IGN. I couldn't help but use the imagery, inspiration, and innovation to drive my cocktail.\n---\nThe movie:\n'Citizen Kane' follows the journey of reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he tries to uncover the meaning of the final words of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Thompson follows Kane's troubled life from when his family became unexpectedly wealthy, to the building of his newspaper empire, through two marriages and subsequent divorces, to the raising of a castle, all concluding with his lonely final moments as he uttered his last word: \"Rosebud.\" The film paints the portrait of a life corrupted by money, control, and an unsatisfied longing for something else.\n---\nThe drink:\n'Rosebud'\n1 sugar cube\n4-6 rose petals\n1 bar spoon of rose syrup\n2oz American whiskey \nMuddle sugar cube, rose petals, and rose syrup together. Add whiskey. Add ice and stir. Double strain into a glass over an ice ball (snow-globe) containing a rose.\n---\nThe symbolism:\n*The picture is grainy and black and white with dynamic lighting to mirror the film itself.\n*The drink is a take-off of an Old Fashioned. The simplicity of the drink represents the simplicity of the life Charles Foster Kane longed for and had ripped away from him. His fortune, art, and prestige never made him content.\n*The rose petals and syrup add the floral notes giving the drink its name: 'Rosebud'\n*I chose American whiskey because, as the man himself said: \"I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN.\"\n*The garnish is a rose encased in a \"snow-globe.\" These are the memories Kane yearns so much to have to fill his cold and empty life.\n\n#whiskey #rose #blackandwhite #CitizenKane #homebarawards #mixology #HomeBartender","timestamp":"2018-03-30T15:04:30+0000"},{"id":"17933916448003208","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg3wqT9j07P/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/29095257_213469696053108_7405247264458801152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=25BZ3yR67u4AX9IFbAa&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=0be021e0699287b042a1e0d56664bd6f&oe=6023D985","caption":"Do it once, it's novel; do it twice, it's tradition.

Here is 'Crash Ass'\n\n2-3oz Spiced rum (depending on how strong you want it)\n4oz orange juice\n1oz dry vermouth\n\nAdd ingredients in a glass with ice. Fill with ginger beer. Add a dash of orange bitters. Garnish with an orange twist.\n\nAverage August is all about making drinks with what's in the average home bar. If you would like the chance to have me make an Average August cocktail with your supplies, here's what you gotta do:\n1) Like this post\n2) Follow @Chemistry.cocktails\n3) In the comments below, tell me what liquors, liqueurs, and non-alcoholic beverages you have\n\n#rum #spicedrum #OrangeJuice #orange #bitters #vermouth #crashbandicoot #Whiskey #average #notfancy #simpledrink #cocktails #drinks #MixedDrinks #Mixology #HomeBartender #cheers #Alcohol #liquor #liqueur #originaldrink #mydrink #Cocktailmaking #liqpic #ttcocktails #EmpireMixology #DelightfulDrinks\n@CocktailDayRepost @couriousbartender","timestamp":"2018-08-20T17:14:54+0000"},{"id":"17881250479249377","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BmlbFtBAUg0/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/38523738_1063690400501036_8136013594568425472_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=zc3vcrqU5M0AX94CpKz&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=f8f185a3a19fabd25fb23f40c50fb14c&oe=6025B6BC","caption":"My sister has never been one for alcohol, which makes her liquor cabinet fairly interesting.

The topic: The Big Screen. A movie inspired cocktail. There's no movie that deserves a drink more than 'Citizen Kane'. Called \"the most influential movie ever made\" and \"the #1 movie of all time,\" nominated for 9 academy awards and winner of Best Original Screenplay (1942), this film has withstood the test of time and still tops lists by USA today and IGN. I couldn't help but use the imagery, inspiration, and innovation to drive my cocktail.\n---\nThe movie:\n'Citizen Kane' follows the journey of reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he tries to uncover the meaning of the final words of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Thompson follows Kane's troubled life from when his family became unexpectedly wealthy, to the building of his newspaper empire, through two marriages and subsequent divorces, to the raising of a castle, all concluding with his lonely final moments as he uttered his last word: \"Rosebud.\" The film paints the portrait of a life corrupted by money, control, and an unsatisfied longing for something else.\n---\nThe drink:\n'Rosebud'\n1 sugar cube\n4-6 rose petals\n1 bar spoon of rose syrup\n2oz American whiskey \nMuddle sugar cube, rose petals, and rose syrup together. Add whiskey. Add ice and stir. Double strain into a glass over an ice ball (snow-globe) containing a rose.\n---\nThe symbolism:\n*The picture is grainy and black and white with dynamic lighting to mirror the film itself.\n*The drink is a take-off of an Old Fashioned. The simplicity of the drink represents the simplicity of the life Charles Foster Kane longed for and had ripped away from him. His fortune, art, and prestige never made him content.\n*The rose petals and syrup add the floral notes giving the drink its name: 'Rosebud'\n*I chose American whiskey because, as the man himself said: \"I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN.\"\n*The garnish is a rose encased in a \"snow-globe.\" These are the memories Kane yearns so much to have to fill his cold and empty life.\n\n#whiskey #rose #blackandwhite #CitizenKane #homebarawards #mixology #HomeBartender","timestamp":"2018-03-30T15:04:30+0000"},{"id":"17933916448003208","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg3wqT9j07P/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/29095257_213469696053108_7405247264458801152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=25BZ3yR67u4AX9IFbAa&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=0be021e0699287b042a1e0d56664bd6f&oe=6023D985","caption":"Do it once, it's novel; do it twice, it's tradition.

Pictured here, (left to right, back to front) are a 'Grayhound' (grapefruit juice and vodka), 'Rum & Coke (dark rum and cola), 'Gin & Tonic' (gin and tonic), and a '7&7' (whiskey and lemon-lime soda). Ratios are whatever the drinker likes best!\n\nGot a favorite two ingredient cocktail?

The topic: The Big Screen. A movie inspired cocktail. There's no movie that deserves a drink more than 'Citizen Kane'. Called \"the most influential movie ever made\" and \"the #1 movie of all time,\" nominated for 9 academy awards and winner of Best Original Screenplay (1942), this film has withstood the test of time and still tops lists by USA today and IGN. I couldn't help but use the imagery, inspiration, and innovation to drive my cocktail.\n---\nThe movie:\n'Citizen Kane' follows the journey of reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he tries to uncover the meaning of the final words of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Thompson follows Kane's troubled life from when his family became unexpectedly wealthy, to the building of his newspaper empire, through two marriages and subsequent divorces, to the raising of a castle, all concluding with his lonely final moments as he uttered his last word: \"Rosebud.\" The film paints the portrait of a life corrupted by money, control, and an unsatisfied longing for something else.\n---\nThe drink:\n'Rosebud'\n1 sugar cube\n4-6 rose petals\n1 bar spoon of rose syrup\n2oz American whiskey \nMuddle sugar cube, rose petals, and rose syrup together. Add whiskey. Add ice and stir. Double strain into a glass over an ice ball (snow-globe) containing a rose.\n---\nThe symbolism:\n*The picture is grainy and black and white with dynamic lighting to mirror the film itself.\n*The drink is a take-off of an Old Fashioned. The simplicity of the drink represents the simplicity of the life Charles Foster Kane longed for and had ripped away from him. His fortune, art, and prestige never made him content.\n*The rose petals and syrup add the floral notes giving the drink its name: 'Rosebud'\n*I chose American whiskey because, as the man himself said: \"I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN.\"\n*The garnish is a rose encased in a \"snow-globe.\" These are the memories Kane yearns so much to have to fill his cold and empty life.\n\n#whiskey #rose #blackandwhite #CitizenKane #homebarawards #mixology #HomeBartender","timestamp":"2018-03-30T15:04:30+0000"},{"id":"17933916448003208","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg3wqT9j07P/","media_type":"IMAGE","media_url":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/29095257_213469696053108_7405247264458801152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=25BZ3yR67u4AX9IFbAa&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=0be021e0699287b042a1e0d56664bd6f&oe=6023D985","caption":"Do it once, it's novel; do it twice, it's tradition.
